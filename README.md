# ToDo App with Vuex

Hi! This is a simple **Vue.js + Vuex** implementation. In this app you can **create, edit, complete, delete** and **clear the completed tasks**. And the fun thing is they are stored in the browser as cookies, and not disappearing after the refresh! 

If you want to try it out you can simply click **Code > Copy Icon** and go to your Terminal/Cmd etc.

    git clone THIS_REPOSITORY_LINK

After cloning is finished, you **must** install the npm in order to run.

    npm install
    
Then, you are ready to give it a shot! Just type

    npm run serve
and you will see the project in your browser!
